# Dice-rolling-simulator
A simple die rolling simulator. When you run the program, it waits for you to press Enter. Each time you press Enter, it shows a randomly selected dice face (from 1 to 6) using text-based ASCII art. You can choose to roll again or exit the game. It's a fun and easy way to learn about random numbers, user input, and loops in Python.
